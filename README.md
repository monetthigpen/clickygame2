# clickygame2
A memory game with React.
Click on an image to earn points, but don't click on any more than once!

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
